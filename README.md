### Planning Story
Considering the time frame I was given to make this website, I planned out its creation so that the repo set-up and the user authentication, as well as the the API calls for creating a new game were finished in the first day of work. I planned to give myself the second day of work to finish anything I hadn't on the first day and create the UI for the game board, and make the second round of API calls to update the game. This worked out well, as I was able to complete all of this and had time to work on some basic styling for the site. The third day of work would involve the game logic and setting win conditions, so I planned to only work on that to make sure it was fully done. Throughout this day, when issues arose, to give myself time to think, I would work on other aspects of the site, like styling or tweaking the UI, so my time would not only be spent on pondering possible solutions. I had planned the fourth day to be the UI for the updating game board, the index of the user's played games and the styling for the site, but I had worked on those or finished them during the first three days, so I continued working on the game logic for the majority of the fourth day. Due to my startegy when I hit a snag in my process, I was able to achieve more than I had planned for.
